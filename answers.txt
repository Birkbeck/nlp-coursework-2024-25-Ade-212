1d. The Flesh Kincaid score is useful for gauging general readability but it can be unreliable when its applied to texts that fall outside its narrow focus on sentence length and syllable counts. For example, highly technical or domain-specific writings like legal documents, scientific articles, or medical reports tends to rely on precise terminology and complex concepts or equations that the formula cannot capture. Despite short sentences or familiar words, the specific terminology may remain difficult to understand for non-experts, especially within the appropriate context. Likewise, very short excerpts or non-prose genres such as poetry, dialogue-heavy scripts or even computer code tend to undermine its reliability. A single long sentence or some polysyllabic words can skew the score, and unconventional structure means the algorithm simply doesnâ€™t map onto the way these texts are meant to be read. In both cases, Flesch Kincaid stops being a valid proxy for true difficulty.
